# Data Quality Control Using R

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the presentation given to the Santa Barbara R Users community. The event took place on June 16th from 1-2pm PDT (MeetUp link [here](https://www.meetup.com/Santa-Barbara-R-Users-Group/events/286355404/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=braze_canvas&utm_campaign=mmrk_alleng_event_announcement_prod_v6_en&utm_term=promo&utm_content=lp_meetup)).

While the code in this repository is meant to be relatively self-explanatory, we do have slides (in GoogleSlides format) that were presented in addition (see [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uYX45wOeZg5vfbjecR9-JWbthwxdEEbbLV3XVXztIF8/edit#slide=id.p))
